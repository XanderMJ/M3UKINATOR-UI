# M3UKINATOR-UI
Creating a tkinter User-Inferface around to M3UKINATOR

## Setup:
* Install the modules (see `requirements.txt`)
* Navigate to the file `data/client_info.py` and set the `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` the match you developer Spotify account.
* Run `python main.py`

On first use, it will prompt a browser window, login to Spotify and copy the redirect url to the terminal. This creates a file called `tekore.cfg` (see the spotify python tekore library) that will manage your tokens from now on.
